1.This code snippet is complex so I added a slides 'task recap.pptx' to illustrate my work and all the files. Pls refer to that to see more details.

2.The code file with the suffix 'ipynb' can be open in Jupyter Notebook while that with the suffix 'py'.

3.Maybe the code and files will be update along with the requirements of the assignment. Im not sure.
