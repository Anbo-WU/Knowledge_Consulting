1.This code mainly invokes the ‘pdfplumber’ stdlib to complete text format conversion.

2.The approach is open-ended, I know some people also materialise it using 'unstructured' library. The performance is almost the same.

3.The 'test4trans.pdf' file is the template file for conversion n the result is the file 'test4trans.txt'.

4.The code file with the suffix 'ipynb' can be open in Jupyter Notebook while that with the suffix 'py' obviously can be open in most python interpreters(e.g. PyCharm).

5.This code will not be updated significantly unless encountered with special circumstances.
